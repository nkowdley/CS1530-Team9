Server DNS:
http://ec2-52-26-93-134.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

    *Server source is the github repo, thus to view any files on it access using path of the repo, 
     i.e. http://ec2-52-26-93-134.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/source/index.html to access the main 
     page
     
To add to server:
** Not currently working **
-I am attempting to make it so repo changes are automatically propagated to the server, but this requires
 adding a webhook to the repo (to the http://ec2-52-26-93-134.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/auto.php file
 which is on the servers gitignore), which should call a script cuasing the server to pull. For the time 
 being I made a http://ec2-52-26-93-134.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/pull.php page which will cuase the 
 server to pull.
 
-I also will make accounts for everyone and grant any necessary permissions, allowing for ssh and ftp
 access for any purpose. These must be password protected. If any one wants root access, ask me and I 
 will provide the .pem key.
