We presented the product of the initial sprint to the customer and he was pleased with our progress so far and had few criticisms or suggestions to offer.  This was most likely due to the fact that all we had to show him was the walking skeleton of our program.  We presented our Google Maps API fully functional and centering on Pittsburgh, PA upon loading of the page.  Afterwards we reviewed some of the important user stories to confirm that we were in aggreement with our development plan and priorities.
