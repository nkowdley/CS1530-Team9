Name of Project: PicChat

Creating a map-centric social media platform. A user will log in, and be able to create posts and content by providing a location and the content itself.
The content will then be place on a map, so that other users can view activities and posts at a specific location and be able to find activities to do at certain locations.

DEMO!

Process:
Before we assigned tasks for each sprint, we met with the client to show them our progress and repriortize the backlog.
We then met as a group and selected backlog items for the current sprint, and then divided them up.
Each Sprint, we assigned tasks and ensured that we could work on them fairly independently.
After we completed our tasks, we met up and did in person code reviews.
We also ran our tests again to ensure nothing major broke between sprints.

Major Challenges:
1)Technical Debt
a)PHP
b)JS
c)Maps API
d)MySQL

Scope was too large to be completed in the right amount of time.  In most cases we cut down on scope to increase quality. IRON TRIANGLE
Local Host/API keys->had different set ups
File IO stuff
