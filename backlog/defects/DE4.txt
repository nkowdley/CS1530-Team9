DE4 - User Interface

The UI that is currently in place in the website is not on the same level as the UI specification. There are various areas that are not implemented exactly as specified and does not conform to the defined standard. This was found through manual testing from the customer as well as internal manual testing. This has been left in since there are higher priority user stories to work on.
