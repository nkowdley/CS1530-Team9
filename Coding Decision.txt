Coding Decisions:

Maps Demo showing off access of the Google Maps API was a very bare bones implementation, merely bringing up the map at base.
This is done just to show ability to access the API. The API key is in the code itself, which is horrible practice and will be fixed later.
I didn't bother with initially using best practices as the API key is restricted to use on the AWS server URL only, so it should not be a 
problem in the short term.

The test Demo is a simple assert to show use of Qunit. Also included is a test for the Map demo, testing the gotoMap function, which should return
a Google Map object, and checks it for true, as if the call failed it should return null.
